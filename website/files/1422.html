<h1>Question Code : 1422</h1>
<h1>Problem Name : <a href=http://lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1422 target="_blank" > Halloween Costumes</a></h1><br/>
<h3>Problem Tags :

<p class=MsoNormal><img src="data/problems/desc/1422/a.jpg" 
align=right hspace=12>Gappu has a very busy weekend ahead of him. Because, next 
weekend is Halloween, and he is planning to attend as many parties as he can. 
Since it's Halloween, these parties are all costume parties, Gappu always 
selects his costumes in such a way that it blends with his friends, that is, 
when he is attending the party, arranged by his comic-book-fan friends, he will 
go with the costume of Superman, but when the party is arranged contest-buddies, 
he would go with the costume of 'Chinese Postman'.</p> 

<p class=MsoNormal>Since he is going to attend a number of parties on the 
Halloween night, and wear costumes accordingly, he will be changing his 
costumes a number of times. So, to make things a little easier, he may put on 
costumes one over another (that is he may wear the uniform for the postman, 
over the superman costume). Before each party he can take off some of the 
costumes, or wear a new one. That is, if he is wearing the Postman uniform over 
the Superman costume, and wants to go to a party in Superman costume, he can 
take off the Postman uniform, or he can wear a new Superman uniform. But, keep 
in mind that, Gappu doesn't like to wear dresses without cleaning them first, 
so, after taking off the Postman uniform, he cannot use that again in the 
Halloween night, if he needs the Postman costume again, he will have to use a 
new one. He can take off any number of costumes, and if he takes off <b>k</b> 
of the costumes, that will be the last <b>k</b> ones (e.g. if he wears costume <b>A</b> 
before costume <b>B</b>, to take off <b>A</b>, first he has to remove <b>B</b>).</p> 

<p class=MsoNormal>Given the parties and the costumes, find the minimum number 
of costumes Gappu will need in the Halloween night. </p>
